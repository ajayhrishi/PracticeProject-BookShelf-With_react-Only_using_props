I am currently in the process of learning React and working on a simple project that involves creating and deleting books. For this project, I have chosen not to use the context system in order to gain a better understanding of working with props. Once I complete this project, I plan to proceed with another application that utilizes the context system to explore its various aspects.

Throughout the development process, I will be adding additional notes and documentation to enhance the project's clarity and readability. This will serve as a valuable reference for future learning and understanding.
